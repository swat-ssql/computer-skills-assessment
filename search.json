    "text": "Introduction\nThis assessment should take around 10-20 minutes to complete in full.\nThe assessment is designed to briefly assess some core college level and above computer skills: mouse skills, keyboard shortcuts, file and folder management, and organization within a document. As our computing devices have become more sophisticated, many of these skills have become less familiar. Yet these skills streamline all work on a computer. They also open the door to more advanced computing such as complex research projects, coding, and quantitative analyses.\nThe assessment does not comprehensively test your skills. Instead, it quickly spot checks them. If any of the tasks within a section are unfamiliar, you are likely missing other related skills as well. If so, practice a more comprehensive set of computer skills in the tutorials.\nDepending on your screen size, links to each section of the assessment will appear either in the left hand navigation panel or from the list icon at the top left of the screen. A link the next section is also included at the bottom right of each section.",

To test yourself fairly, do not look through the tasks before starting them.\nThere are two ways to complete the assessment.\n\nWork with each section in this online webbook. Copy-paste relevant sections into a Word or Google Doc.\nDownload the Word version of this assessment. From there, you can complete each section in Google Docs or Microsoft Word. This allows you to\n\nsave your work and\navoid rote copy-pasting text into a new Word document or Google Doc.",

They also require applying the skills through practice. You can train your fingers to dance over the computer keyboard like a pianist’s fingers dance over piano keys.\nSkills: Work through the tutorials at https://swat-ssql.github.io/computer-skills-tutorials. You can also Google topics such as “computer shortcuts,” “file management,” and “navigation pane” to find additional tips and tricks.\nPractice: Spend time practicing the skills. Play Minesweeper and Solitaire on your computer.\nCome back to the assessment once you feel prepared.",

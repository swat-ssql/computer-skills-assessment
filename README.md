# Computer Skills Assessment
This assessment is designed to briefly assess your computer skills. As our computing devices have become more sophisticated, many core computing skills as as keyboard shortcuts, file management, and navigating sections in a document have become less familiar. Yet these skills streamline all work on a computer. They also open the door to more advanced computing, such as complex research projects, coding, and quantitative analyses.

The assessment does not comprehensively test your skills. Instead, it quickly spot checks them. If any of the tasks are unfamiliar, you are likely missing other key skills as well. If so, practice a more comprehensive set of computer skills in the tutorials at https://swat-ssql.github.io/computer-skills-tutorials.
